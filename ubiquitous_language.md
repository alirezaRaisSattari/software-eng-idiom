**Ubiquitous Language in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) means:**

A shared language between developers and domain experts that is used consistently in the code, documentation, and conversations about the system.

Key Points:
- All team members (devs, managers, domain experts) use the same terms with the same meaning.

- These terms appear in class names, methods, and modules in code.

Why it's important:
- Reduces miscommunication.

- Keeps code aligned with business rules.

- Helps both technical and non-technical people understand the system.
